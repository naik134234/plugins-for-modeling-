# 🔵 TYPES OF MODELLING (COMPLETE THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATION)

This document provides a master explanation of modelling types, serving as the theoretical foundation for the Risk Modeling Platform.

## 1️⃣ FINANCIAL MODELLING

Financial modelling involves building structured representations of a company’s or asset’s **financial performance** to support decision-making.

### 🔹 Types of Financial Models

#### 1.1 Three-Statement Model
Integrates:
* Income Statement
* Balance Sheet
* Cash Flow Statement

**Used for:** Company analysis, Forecasting, Valuation foundation.

#### 1.2 Budgeting & Forecasting Models
**Used to:** Predict revenues, costs, cash flows; Plan financial performance.
**Common in:** Corporate finance, FP&A roles.
* *Implemented in Platform:* **Capital Budgeting (NPV, IRR, Payback)**

#### 1.3 Valuation Models
**Used to:** Estimate intrinsic value.
**Types:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Comparable Company Analysis, Precedent Transaction Analysis.

#### 1.4 Sensitivity & Scenario Models
**Used to:** Analyze impact of variable changes, Best / worst / base cases.
* *Implemented in Platform:* **One-Way Sensitivity Analysis**

---

## 2️⃣ ECONOMIC & MACRO MODELLING

Used to analyze relationships between economic variables.

### 🔹 Types
*   **Econometric Models**: Regression, Time series.
*   **Macroeconomic Models**: Inflation, GDP, Interest rates.

---

## 3️⃣ RISK MODELLING (CORE PLATFORM FOCUS)

Risk modelling estimates potential losses and uncertainties.

### 🔹 Types of Risk Models

#### 3.1 Market Risk Models
**Used to:** Measure losses due to market movements.
* *Implemented in Platform:* **Value at Risk (VaR)** (Historical, Parametric, Monte Carlo)

#### 3.2 Credit Risk Models
**Used to:** Assess default risk.
**Examples:** Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD).
* *Implemented in Platform:* **Merton Structural Model**

#### 3.3 Operational Risk Models
**Used to:** Assess losses from process failures, human errors, system failures.

---

## 4️⃣ STATISTICAL MODELLING

Statistical modelling uses mathematical relationships to explain data behavior.

### 🔹 Types
*   **Regression Models**: Linear, Multiple, Logistic.
*   **Time Series Models**: ARIMA, GARCH, Exponential smoothing.

---

## 5️⃣ QUANTITATIVE MODELLING (QUANTS)

Used heavily in capital markets and trading.

### 🔹 Types
*   **Pricing Models**: Black-Scholes (used in Merton Model logic), Binomial option pricing.
*   **Portfolio Models**: Mean-Variance Optimization, CAPM.

---

## 6️⃣ DERIVATIVES MODELLING

Used to value and manage derivative instruments.
*   Futures pricing, Options pricing, Interest rate models.

---

## 7️⃣ FINANCIAL RISK SIMULATION MODELS

Simulation models replicate multiple future outcomes.

### 🔹 Types
#### 7.1 Monte Carlo Simulation
**Used for:** VaR, Pricing, Stress testing.
* *Implemented in Platform:* **Generic Monte Carlo Engine**

#### 7.2 Scenario Simulation
**Used for:** Crisis analysis, Tail risk assessment.

---

## 8️⃣ MACHINE LEARNING MODELLING (MODERN FINANCE)

Uses algorithms to learn from data patterns.

### 🔹 Types
*   **Supervised Learning**: Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
*   **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, PCA.
*   **Deep Learning**: LSTM, Neural Networks.

---

## 9️⃣ OPERATIONAL & PROCESS MODELLING

Used in operations, banking, and shared services.
*   Workflow models, SLA/KRA models.

---

## 🔟 DECISION MODELLING

Used to support managerial decisions.
*   Cost-benefit models, Break-even models, Optimization models.

## 🔥 INTERVIEW CHEATSHEET

> "Modelling can be broadly classified into financial, risk, statistical, quantitative, simulation, machine learning, and operational modelling, each serving different decision-making and analytical objectives."

### How to Answer Based on Depth
*   **Basic**: Financial, risk, and statistical models.
*   **Advanced**: Risk, quantitative, simulation, and ML models.
*   **Role-specific**: Risk, operational, and reporting models.
